The team plans to build a token corpus for each video and use NLP methods to get a reasonable distance between videos on the title and description columns.

There are huge amounts of values that appear only once, which increases the difficulty to calculate the distance between two samples. Moreover, there are mistakes during loading data to the dataset, for example, the duration is loaded to rating.
